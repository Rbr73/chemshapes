Welcome to ChemShapes Host Software. 

If you find any issues, bugs or suggestions, please report it on this page: 

        https://github.com/hradec/chemshapes/issues
        
        
If you're in Windows, just double click on:

    Click here to run Chemshapes Host Software.cmd
    

for OSX and Linux, there are dependencies that you need to install before hand:

    1. PyOpenGL
    2. PySide
    3. Qt 4.7
    
    
I'm looking on an standalone way to run it on OSX, for examplem, using py2app to generate
a self-contained Mac App. 

If you have experience with py2app and py2exe, please feel free to help me out!!!! =)

Just make sure to put your code/setup into appropriate folders: 
    
        build/win - makefiles to generate windows .exe
        build/osx - makefiles to generate mac standalone app
        build/linux - makefiles to generate linux packages
